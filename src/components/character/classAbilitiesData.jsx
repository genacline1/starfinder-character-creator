For instance, you can conceal a personal comm unit inside a pair of hoverskates or a detonator inside a basic medkit. The concealed item easily passes casual inspection, but someone using a scanner or performing a close inspection can discover it with a successful Perception check (DC = 10 + your total Engineering skill modifier – the concealed item’s bulk [minimum 1]). Both devices retain their normal functionality and require their own batteries, but if the concealed device requires a skill check to use, the user takes a –2 penalty to that skill check. You can’t conceal weapons or armor or conceal items in weapons or armor.\n\nStarting at 5th level, you can conceal the functional parts of a technological item or a ranged weapon inside a technological object of the same size, as long as that object is at least 1 bulk. For instance, you can conceal an azimuth laser pistol inside a large-enough musical instrument or a pulsecaster pistol inside a beacon. Concealing a weapon in this way imposes a –2 penalty to attack rolls with that weapon and reduces its range by half. This requires an additional hour of work and an amount of UPBs equal to 10% of the concealed item.\n\nIn either case, do not combine the bulk of the two devices; only the higher bulk counts toward a character’s bulk limit.',
